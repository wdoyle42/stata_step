The goal of this course to help you to prepare a paper that can be presented at a major research conference and, hopefully, submitted to a journal for publication. To accomplish this goal, you will choose from among publicly available datasets. You will identify a research topic, then later a research question. You will create a dataset using the publicly available sources. By the end of the semester, you will have a properly formatted and cleaned dataset, with auxiliary information from other sources included. Next semester we will analyze this dataset. By the end of May, you will complete a paper based on this analysis. Along the way, you will develop skills that will be helpful in future work using any kind of data. This class has a strong emphasis on using programming skills to aid in the replication of work and to simplify complex analyses. "],

An example template is also posted on the course website. The point is to have a standard structure that will make sense for every new *.do file you create. 2.2 Downloading packages (*.ado files) One of Stata’s great virtues is that it is highly extensible. Users are frequently creating new commands for Stata and posting them on the web. To get these commands, we use the net search command. From there, a list of possible matches will be presented. After choosing the one you want, go ahead and download it into Stata. You now have access to the new command. . net search renvars (contacting http://www.stata.com) 4 packages found (Stata Journal and STB listed first) ----------------------------------------------------- dm88_1 from http://www.stata-journal.com/software/sj5-4 SJ5-4 dm88_1.

It has all of 2.3 Loading data Stata data files end in *.dta. They are easily loaded with the use command. Some datasets, like the one we will use today, can be downloaded from the Stata website directly with the webuse command. While we won’t really use these toy datasets in our research, they can come in handy for small exercises (such as we will do today). They are also the datasets used in the Stata help files. . webuse school, clear 2.4 outsheet dataset Stata can export data in almost any commonly-used format. The most commonly used format for data files is in what’s called ASCII delimited form, with a delimiter of either a comma or a tab. To export a dataset we use the outsheet command. You can specify which variables from the current dataset you’d like to export. *.csv is a good format for Microsoft Excel files. . outsheet using &quot;school_data.csv&quot;, comma replace 2.4.0.1 QUICK EXERCISE Export the current dataset in tab delimited format, then go ahead and open up the new dataset in Excel. 2.5 insheet dataset Similarly, Stata can read in data in most any format using the insheet command: . insheet using &quot;school_data.csv&quot;, comma clear (11 vars, 95 obs) 2.6 describe dataset Once you have your dataset in memory, you can describe it to get a quick overview of what you have: . describe Contains data obs: 95 vars: 11 size: 1,900 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- storage display value variable name type format label variable label ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- obs byte %8.0g pub12 byte %8.0g pub34 byte %8.0g pub5 byte %8.0g private byte %8.0g years byte %8.0g school byte %8.0g loginc float %9.0g logptax float %9.0g vote byte %8.0g logeduc float %9.0g ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorted by: Note: dataset has changed since last saved 2.7 Labeling data and variables Properly labeling datasets and variables will make life much easier for you and anyone else who uses your dataset. To label an entire dataset, use the label data command: . label data &quot;Voting on school expenditures&quot; To label variables, use the label variable command: . label variable loginc &quot;Log of income&quot; . label variable vote &quot;Voted for public school funding&quot; Make sure that your variable labels are highly descriptive and directional (e.g., instead of labeling a binary variable gender label it female). We can see our labels if once again describe our data: . describe Contains data obs: 95 Voting on school expenditures vars: 11 size: 1,900 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- storage display value variable name type format label variable label ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- obs byte %8.0g pub12 byte %8.0g pub34 byte %8.0g pub5 byte %8.0g private byte %8.0g years byte %8.0g school byte %8.0g loginc float %9.0g Log of income logptax float %9.0g vote byte %8.0g Voted for public school funding logeduc float %9.0g ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorted by: Note: dataset has changed since last saved 2.8 Labeling values within variables For many binary/categorical variables, you’ll want to say what the underlying levels of the variable in the dataset mean. This is a two-part process. First you define the label values through label define; next you apply them to your particular variable with label values &lt;variable&gt; &lt;label&gt;: . tab vote Voted for | public | school | funding | Freq. Percent Cum. ------------+----------------------------------- 0 | 36 37.89 37.89 1 | 59 62.11 100.00 ------------+----------------------------------- Total | 95 100.00 . label define voteopts 0 &quot;no&quot; 1 &quot;yes&quot; . label values vote voteopts . tab vote Voted for | public | school | funding | Freq. Percent Cum. ------------+----------------------------------- no | 36 37.89 37.89 yes | 59 62.11 100.00 ------------+----------------------------------- Total | 95 100.00 2.9 Transforming variables Transforming a variable refers to using an operation to create a new version of an existing variable. In our dataset, both income and household spending on education are expressed in terms of the natural log of the existing variable. If we want to have the values of these variables in nominal scale, we need to use the gen command to create a new variable: . gen inc = exp(loginc) . sum loginc inc Variable | Obs Mean Std. Dev. Min Max -------------+-------------------------------------------------------- loginc | 95 9.971017 .4118853 8.294 10.82 inc | 95 23093.31 8871.35 3999.8 50011.07 2.10 Recoding variables Recoding a variable involves changing the values of a variable based on its existing variables. We often want to recode variables in order to make them more useful for whatever analysis we’re working on. I’ll show you two different ways of recoding, one based on the gen command and a more complicated one using the egen commend with the recode command: . gen inc_bin = 0 . replace inc_bin = 1 if inc &gt; r(mean) (30 real changes made) . egen inc_q = cut(inc), group(4) . recode inc_q (0 = 1 &quot;First Quartile&quot;) /// &gt; (1 = 2 &quot;2nd Quartile&quot;) /// &gt; (2 = 3 &quot;3rd Quartile&quot;) /// &gt; (3 = 4 &quot;4th Quartile&quot;), gen(new_inc_q) (95 differences between inc_q and new_inc_q) 2.10.0.1 QUICK EXERCISE Create a variable that is equal to 1 if it’s greater than the median of income. Properly label the variable and its values. 2.11 Computing a new variable Computing a variable involves using the values of other variables to create a new variable. For instance, to calculate an effective property tax rate, we want to divide the property tax value by income: . gen ptax = exp(logptax) . gen taxrate = ptax / inc 2.12 EXERCISES Create a new binary variable for whether or not the family has any children in public schools. Properly label your variable and variable values. Create a new variable for percent of household income spent on education. Properly label your new variable. Create a new variable for persons with low, moderate and high percentages of spending on education. Label the variable and value labels properly. Tabulate household spending and voting for public school funding. What do you find? Init: 06 June 2015; Updated: 04 September 2017 "]
